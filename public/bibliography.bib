	abstract = {Crick and Mitchison1 have presented a hypothesis for the functional role of dream sleep involving an ‘unlearning’ process. We have independently carried out mathematical and computer modelling of learning and ‘unlearning’ in a collective neural network of 30–1,000 neurones. The model network has a content-addressable memory or ‘associative memory’ which allows it to learn and store many memories. A particular memory can be evoked in its entirety when the network is stimulated by any adequate-sized subpart of the information of that memory2. But different memories of the same size are not equally easy to recall. Also, when memories are learned, spurious memories are also created and can also be evoked. Applying an ‘unlearning’ process, similar to the learning processes but with a reversed sign and starting from a noise input, enhances the performance of the network in accessing real memories and in minimizing spurious ones. Although our model was not motivated by higher nervous function, our system displays behaviours which are strikingly parallel to those needed for the hypothesized role of ‘unlearning’ in rapid eye movement ({REM}) sleep.},

   abstract    = {This study investigates the effects of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
 sampling in unsupervised Maximum Likelihood (ML) learning. Our attention is
 restricted to the family of unnormalized probability densities for which the
 negative log density (or energy function) is a ConvNet. In general, we find
 that many of the techniques used to stabilize training in previous studies can
 have the opposite effect. Stable ML learning with a ConvNet potential can be
 achieved with only a few hyper-parameters and no regularization. Using this
 minimal framework, we identify a variety of ML learning outcomes that depend on
 the implementation of MCMC sampling.
   On one hand, we show that it is easy to train an energy-based model which can
 sample realistic images with short-run Langevin. ML can be effective and stable
 even when MCMC samples have much higher energy than true steady-state samples
 throughout training. Based on this insight, we introduce an ML method with
 purely noise-initialized MCMC, high-quality short-run synthesis, and the same
 budget as ML with informative MCMC initialization such as CD or PCD. Unlike
 previous models, our model can obtain realistic high-diversity samples from a
 noise signal after training with no auxiliary networks.
   On the other hand, ConvNet potentials learned with highly non-convergent MCMC
 do not have a valid steady-state and cannot be considered approximate
 unnormalized densities of the training data because long-run MCMC samples
 differ greatly from observed images. We show that it is much harder to train a
 ConvNet potential to learn a steady-state over realistic images. To our
 knowledge, long-run MCMC samples of all previous models lose the realism of
 short-run samples. With correct tuning of Langevin noise, we train the first
 ConvNet potentials for which long-run and steady-state MCMC samples are
 realistic images.},

 approaches to both discriminative and generative learning, with circuits based
 on tree and matrix product state tensor networks that could have benefits for
 near-term devices. The result is a unified framework where classical and
 quantum computing can benefit from the same theoretical and algorithmic
 developments, and the same model can be trained classically then transferred to
 the quantum setting for additional optimization. Tensor network circuits can
 also provide qubit-efficient schemes where, depending on the architecture, the
 number of physical qubits required scales only logarithmically with, or
 independently of the input or output data sizes. We demonstrate our proposals
 with numerical experiments, training a discriminative model to perform
 handwriting recognition using a optimization procedure that could be carried
 out on quantum hardware, and testing the noise resilience of the trained model.},

 mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information
 theory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training

 end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a 'quantum' lower-bound
 to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte
 Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of QVAEs. To
 achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete
 latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our model
 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared
 against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the
 generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to
 be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We
 show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are
 relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to
 the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance
 for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the
 full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling

As an example, we study the 2-dimensional {\textpm}J Edwards-Anderson model. The new algorithm allows us to equilibrate systems of size 1002 down to temperature T = 0.1. Our main result is that the correlation length diverges as an exponential ( $\xi$∼e2$\beta$J) and not as a power law as T↦Tc = 0.",

 abstract = {Spin glasses are disordered magnetic systems that have led to the development of mathematical tools with an array of real-world applications, from airline scheduling to neural networks.Spin Glasses and Complexityoffers the most concise, engaging, and accessible introduction to the subject, fully explaining what spin glasses are, why they are important, and how they are opening up new ways of thinking about complexity.This one-of-a-kind guide to spin glasses begins by explaining the fundamentals of order and symmetry in condensed matter physics and how spin glasses fit into--and modify--this framework. It then explores how spin-glass concepts and ideas have found applications in areas as diverse as computational complexity, biological and artificial neural networks, protein folding, immune response maturation, combinatorial optimization, and social network modeling.Providing an essential overview of the history, science, and growing significance of this exciting field, Spin Glasses and Complexityalso features a forward-looking discussion of what spin glasses may teach us in the future about complex systems. This is a must-have book for students and practitioners in the natural and social sciences, with new material even for the experts.},

pure states, overlaps, overlap distribution, replica symmetry breaking, and the
static transition; dynamics, covering the generating functional method, generalized
Langevin equation, equations for the correlation and the response, the mode
coupling approximation, and the dynamical transition; and finally complexity,
covering the mean-field (ThoulessâAndersonâPalmer) free energy, metastable states,
entropy crisis, threshold energy, and saddles. Particular attention has been paid
to the mutual consistency of the results obtained from the different methods.}
